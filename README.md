## Five Things, a bulletpoint review site.

> A quick way to build up a list of concepts to merge together to build a sketch premise.

This was built with the T3 Stack project bootstrapped with create-t3-app with:

- React (Next.js)
- TailwindCSS
- shadcn/ui UI Library
- Vercel Hosting

### NOTES:

- Tailwind is paying for itself already. much easier to use than the usual inline styles

### TODO:

- [x] Basic Setup and Deployment check to Vercel
- [x] Establish Debug
- [x] Set up basic UI
- [] Set up Options Menu
- [] Set up tutorial docs
- [] Set up Timer
- [] Set up nav menu
- [] Set up About Page Explaining functions
- [] Set up option settings
- [] Check basic UI mobile compatibility
