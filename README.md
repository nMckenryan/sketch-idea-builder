This was built with the T3 Stack project bootstrapped with create-t3-app with:

- React (Next.js)
- TailwindCSS
- shadcn/ui UI Library
- Vercel Hosting

### TODO:

- [x] Basic Setup and Deployment check to Vercel
- [x] Establish Debug
- [x] Set up basic UI
- [x] Set up tutorial popup basic
- [x] Set up nav menu
- [x] Set up About Page Explaining functions
- [x] Check basic UI mobile compatibility
